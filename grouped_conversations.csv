greetings
all ph_technical applications and tomcat are using ph_technical . 2 so please check it on test server and confirm to apply the same on production
dear  ph_user
our iso team preform a scanning on both uat servers ph_ip_address , ph_ip_address to test the fixed ph_technical but unfortunately still we can see same vulnerabilities are open .
please refer to attached excel sheet where you can find list of tls ph_path related ph_technical and http trace method enabled ph_technical are still reported .

in the new report you have 2 issues as below :
1- used cipher : please share requimended cipher for tls 1.2 to configure it from our end .
2- self sign certificate : ph_technical dosn't have it is  ph_user  certificate so please share ph_technical for all ph_technical tools to request certificate for the same or we can use one certificate for all ph_technical tools with different ports
greetings
the attached mail contains the list of recommended ciphers for ph_technical .
ph_technical

all recommended tls 1.2 cipher has been applied along with the new ph_technical
dear  ph_user
please provide production file fixes so that will move same changes in production .
greetings
is it confirmed by your security team ph_technical

greetings
the change has been applied only in  ph_user  application, in  ph_user  ph_name we counter an issue in the integration with esb.
and conventional  ph_user , all online payments getting failed while ph_technical the status of the regulated entity and also the integration with ph_technical failed.
we plan today for ph_technical ph_path , kindly go through the deployment steps.
we need to make sure that nothing is missed.
in ph_technical there integration with ph_technical
dear  ph_user
please take the required action as per the recommendation from our iso team to close this ph_technical reported in  ph_user  and  ph_user  .
“for the those debug directories and sub directories at least can disable by set the response as ph_technical or ph_technical for all the web users ”
please refer to mail for more details
greetings
this can't be done as it is ph_technical request coming from the user direct and can't be disabled .
dear  ph_user
we have some ph_technical related to our os we just need your confirmation there is no application dependency to fix open ph_technical of java .
example :
red hat: ph_technical moderate: ph_technical security and bug fix update (multiple advisories)
i will share the list so that you get more details
greetings
open ph_technical ph_technical is not used in our prod systems
dear  ph_user
thanks lot for your continues support we managed to close big number of vulnerabilities in all ph_name system but still there are list of ph_technical reported as per the latest report .
we also successfully upgraded our certificates from self-signed to ca certificate for all ph_name application .
i will share the attachment for more details where the iso recommended solution is added .

regarding point 1 an 2 please let me know which application is using ph_technical port and share the ph_technical to check it , for point 3,4 i have applied the recommendation over ph_link so please let the team check it and confirm to apply it to all other applications , regarding to http trace issue please let us know how they are doing the test as it is already disabled
dear  ph_user
onus using ph_technical port .
greetings
could you please re-share the latest ph_technical from production onus tomcat to check it .
dear  ph_user
please find the requested ph_technical .
greetings
we have checked the configuration again and this is the only allowed ciphers in the ph_technical 7 which is supported by the onus system
ph_technical
dear  ph_user
iso confirmed the 2 vulnerability are fixed in ph_ip_address server on port ph_technical you can proceed with other application on same fix .
ph_technical  ph_user  smaller than ph_technical bits tls ph_path server is using commonly used prime numbers
for the “ http trace method enabled ” vulnerable, false positive for both servers ( ph_ip_address , ph_ip_address ) they will take exception .
in this case no action required .
and what about onus application below ph_technical we already provided the ph_technical .
we will plan next week production movement for all fixed in one ph_technical , please make sure to provide the fix for all reported ph_technical .
vulnerabilities ip port status tls ph_path server supports ph_technical cipher algorithms (ph_technical) ph_ip_address ph_technical open tls ph_path server supports the use of static key ciphers ph_ip_address ph_technical open
greetings
for this issue you have to change current cipher in the ph_technical to (ph_technical,ph_technical,  ph_user ) for both ph_technical and ph_name
ph_technical
for the
tls ph_path server supports ph_technical cipher algorithms (ph_technical)
tls ph_path server supports the use of static key ciphers
as sent before that you have to check with your security team as current java version doesn't support above ciphers and the only applicable ciphers will be as follow for both ( ph_user  and onus)
ph_technical
greetings
we have check the tls version for all system, kindly refer to the table below:

as you mentioned tls 1.1 is used, kindly can you confirm in what application tls 1.1 is used and can we disable it ph_technical
if yes, is there any impact?
and how we can disable it?
greetings
only tls 1.2 tls 1.1 and 1.0 is disabled and security team can scan and confirm

as discussed, the  ph_user  system is pulling the outward transactions from the ph_name table using database package and scheduler job, that will also do the mapping for outward transactions purpose code, in the reported case there were 4 transactions that contain the purpose description as ‘other’, when the job started and tried to map the description ‘other’ with the code in the  ph_user  lookup the result for the purpose came as null as there is no purpose named ‘other' in our lookup, therefore the transfer of the data wasn't completed as the  ph_user  table will not accept null value in the purpose code column.
after the bank team updated the purpose description to ‘others’ in the ph_name table the transactions were pulled successfully, as agreed please let us know if the purpose description has been changed at your end to add it to our lookup table or if there is any new purposes that needs to be added.

since we cant test and replicate this issue on the test environment, we are required to justify what the changes will impact in each row that we are updating.
we also noticed that most of the codes that are working fine has the same data in the codes that are not working fine, but the script below is still updating them.
since this is a critical application we want to make sure that this change will have no impact on the privileges and that is why we require you assistance to identify the impact of the below change in details.
thank you.
kind regards
greetings
those update statements will not affect old records as both columns should have the correct value so if you have any issue with script you can take backup from the old table before execute the statement and in case any issue found after executing the script you can return the original table below both the backup and the update statement

this is not a valid flow, the ph_technical who signed up will never be allowed to sign up again.
the default flow for such a case is to use the login, and after the login, the user will be redirected to add a profile, ph_technical the ph_technical should enter the new profile details and activate the new profile.
after doing such, the ph_technical central will allow him to log in and use the app.
once a ph_technical gets ph_technical (signed up), he will never be able to use the sign-up again, but he can log in to his profile using his alias and the password.
once he logged in, if he has no authorized accounts, the ph_technical central will reply with ""ph_technical"", ""no active authorized profile"" .
if he is added to be an authorized in one account, then the ph_technical will allow him to activate this profile directly after successful login.

this is new ph_technical and it is the first sign up to him.

“ initially we discussed this with ph_name to know what exactly needs to be sent to the user for such case, and as we agreed on the meeting that we shouldn't expose such message to the users since no one can guarantee if this is the same user or not, and as preferred from your security team and us, we agreed to send a general error to prevent any security breach ” this is what i received from  ph_user  since he was managing this.
the initial response wasn't clear to us on this way, since as we understand that you removed the accounts from an active user, this is why we replied with the first reply.
appreciate to reach your security team and send us an updates to know the next step either from your side or our side.

i just discussed this case with the security team, since all data entered is correct and the issue is from the bank side, there is no risk in displaying the error message ( ph_technical, ""no active authorized profile"" ), specially that the same message appears when activated ph_technical signed in successfully and has no authorization on any account.
however, the message should guide the ph_technical to reach the bank for assistance.

solution:
this monitoring solution was proposed but no confirmation received from the customer:
monitoring backendservice:
database job is deployed on ph_technical and ph_technical and runs every ph_technical mins if the count of failed outward ph_items exceeds x , it sends an email.
monitoring integration:
database job is deployed on ph_name and ph_name and onus and runs every 10 mins if the count of failed integration transactions exceeds x , it sends an email.

greetings
please check this issue with ph_technical and middleware team.
ph_user  is getting an error in the response as you can see in the attached screenshot.
greetings
kindly advise to setup a monitoring alert email setup for such cases.
if there is no response from core banking for certain period of time or certain number of transaction, them email to be triggered so that we can early determine and take care of the situation.
there are hundreds of transactions which the user has to check it manually and time consuming.
kindly check advise any possible solution for this issue.
this issue has repeated 2-3 times and not fixed yet.
thanks for your prompt supports.
greetings what about creating a database job to alert when the number of failed integration transactions reaches a threshold?
greetings as we discussed, if you want to use your monitoring system to alert when there are failed transactions, you  ph_user  depend on the output of this statement.

ph_technical ones with ph_technical ph_technical are the failed ones.
let me know if this satisfies your need.

greetings do you still have any questions about this ticket?
greetings
please advise if you want to run the status query on all schemas.
is it possible to setup the alert in the  ph_user  application or database level.
greetings it can be done on  ph_user  side, but i need to check if this will have a cost.
greetings
kindly refer ticket ph_technical also, all the ow ph_technical were stuck at ph_technical export ( ph_user , ph_technical, ph_technical), and there was no alert and we got  ph_user  customer complaints.
there should be a monitoring tool ph_path for all the services and the queues.
if any service is hung or any queue stuck for certain time or certain numbers of ph_technical, an email alert should be triggered.
kindly check and advise on the permanent solution for this.
thanks.
greetings you stated before that ph_name has a monitoring and ph_technical system; can't it be used to monitor the services you need in  ph_user ph_technical
we have already setup an alert for the application tomcat pages like  ph_user , ph_technical, onus, ph_technical.
but at the services level i don't think its possible.
kindly advise.
greetings i am examining an ph_technical solution right now.
i will update you once i conclude its applicability.
greetings
the monitoring solution that we are proposing is as follow:
monitoring backendservice:
database job is deployed on ph_technical and ph_technical and runs every 10 mins if the count of failed outward ph_items exceeds x , it sends an email.
monitoring integration:
database job is deployed on ph_technical and  ph_user  and onus and runs every ph_technical mins if the count of failed integration transactions exceeds x , it sends an email.
the jobs will be configured to send emails to one correspondence only.
the efforts of this implementation are chargeable and will cost five man-days.
please let me know your thoughts.
how many man-days we are left with and when are they getting expired?
greetings can you please send me your thoughts about the proposed solution and if you need to add anything to it?
we will discuss later the man-days.
greetings
can you please post your thoughts?

we are checking with  ph_user  on the man days.
greetings can you please get back to me on the concept shared?
i am also on zoom ph_technical if you would like to discuss it further.

please let me know what do you about using the database jobs to alert when there is a delay or failure in the ph_technical and integration.

kindly note, chances are that some dependent object, such as a table, is being altered in some way e.g.
dropped and recreated, and this causes the procedures.
depending on it to be marked 'invalid'.
this doesn't necessarily mean that they are invalid as, if you try and use them, oracle will automatically try to recompile them, and if the dependent object is still ok to use it will become 'valid' again automatically.
however, if the dependent object has changed in such a way that the procedure.
cannot be recompiled automatically, then it will remain invalid and we will need to find out what is wrong.
this can be done by trying to compile the procedure via sql editor or some other tool which can report the errors.
please if the procedures still invalid and cannot be compiled, we will take a copy of each and we will ask our developers to tune the procedures.
regards,
ph_user

kindly note that i have tried to re-compile the invalid procedure over rehearsal, and it worked and it becomes valid, so there is no issue with the procedures.

upon investigation on the logs, we found that a user exported a huge number of ph_items from the history query which caused the ph_technical managed server to crash.

log snippet:
ph_logs
greetings
reference to our phone call, we are under the impression that the out of memory exception was due to a bulk export of ph_items from the history query (based on the exception logs provided).
we recommend to do the export of ph_items in chunks in order to avoid this kind of scenario.
as agreed, a remote session tomorrow at 9:30 am will be sent to check the logs for us to identify the user who did the export action on the system.
i will send you the teams meeting request.
regards,
greetings
reference to our remote session, we reached to a conclusion that the out of memory issue was due to the bulk exporting of ph_items.
the same scenario was simulated on the uat environment and the same out of memory exception was reproduced.
in order to prevent this kind of scenario in the future, we are recommending to have the reports in chunks rather thank bulk export.
after thorough investigation on the managed server logs, we were also able to unveil the ip address of the client ph_technical who did the export action.
as agreed, the same report will be forwarded to user services team along with our recommendations.

every time you are requesting us to provide you such reports ph_technical,ph_technical,… and after the investigation we conclude there is no issues on db.
implicitly if we are facing issues on ph_technical this will cause ph_technical on all services.
however, we are providing you a lot of samples to work on them.
regarding turn off the load balancer, provide us clear and details technical steps to perform such activity.
greetings
kindly note, first, the samples you provided me have no issues on our ph_technical but it has a timeout issue due to long processing time, the long processing time is not identified by our ph_technical logs, this makes an assumption that the issue is from a long-running query on database level.
also, as you know we have never received any ph_technical ph_path report from your database side, so we still cannot confirm that there is no issue on the database, in this i mean not a connection issue but long-ops queries.

the issue is more than a timeout..
as per my understanding if any ph_technical timed out or any errors with the ph_technical the transaction must appeared in failed transaction page.
in this page the user can retry again to call the ph_technical or export the transaction for manual processing.
the issue we have is we cant find the ph_item anywhere in the application.
but we see it in the report and the teller cannot process the ph_item again.
the current status now is the amount is debited from the ph_item account and its on hold for the beneficiary account because we did receive the final posting message.
i hope its clear what the issue is.

this is for your immediate notice that while presenting two different ph_items from different banks, the pay bank is receiving same ph_item number in its inward with cycle ph_technical, this has serious flaw in the system.
hence, requesting you to verify the inward page issue in serious way and update us the same at a soonest.
problem: ph_item ph_technical details like pay bank ph_technical, ph_technical ph_technical no, pay branch ph_technical changes when the ph_item reaches the inward side.
investigation and simulation: disable editable option for ph_technical.
and ph_technical in the ph_technical pages (central and bank), by running following
ph_sql
this above changes did not help next change the procedure:
the workaround to avoid the change of ph_technical ph_technical no is to update the following package, ph_technical

for the following two procedures:
1. ph_technical
1.1 add extra condition in the where clause: and ph_technical
1.2 change the error code to :  ph_user ph_technical

2. ph_technical

after the above changes, the system still trying to do auto updates on ph_technical in the inward side, but system avoided it and keep generating a dialogue box that says ph_technical fields cannot be updated.

as we checked the issue from our side, the ph_item cycle sequence is ph_technical since the ph_technical fields are changed for the given ph_item at the inward clearing pages.
so, the ph_item cycle changing in such scenario is system's normal flow.
thank you
ph_user
greetings
i think you are not getting the issue.
everyone of us know that the cycle becomes ph_technical for ph_technical edited ph_items, but the issue is that without ph_technical edit, the ph_technical of one ph_item ph_technical has been updated to ph_technical of another ph_item which is not a normal behavior by the bank.
kindly check the issue severity and update us.

1007408.0,"dear sir ph_path ,
this is for your information that we have observed flaw in inward ph_technical process where ph_items are replied from clearing approval on 11:29:43 am and status updated to ph_technical but the same ph_item was auto-rejected in the system by the ph_technical job despite of having grace period in reply.
this has provided serious hassles and ph_technical penalty to the pay bank, hence request you to verify and provide necessary fix at an earliest.

ph_user   ph_user
problem: ph_items are replied from clearing approval on 11:29:43 am and status updated to ph_technical but the same ph_item was auto-rejected in the system by the ph_technical job despite of having grace period in reply.
this has provided serious hassles and ph_technical penalty to the pay bank, investigation and simulation: test the issue locally
case 1:
we tested the express transaction with parameter ph_technical to 1.
we performed following steps.
ph_user  service stop ph_technical — before the reply time ends
ph_technical 21:29:30pm – reply the ph_item in the last minute
ph_user  service ph_technical – start the  ph_user  service after the reply time ends and before grace period ends
in this case, the ph_item move to pay communication pending and ph_item replied as auto reject during tto.
ph_item not recovered by  ph_user  services even if grace period remaining
case 2:
we tested the express transaction with parameter ph_technical to 0 in both central and bank schema
we performed following steps.
ph_user  service stop ph_technical — before the reply time ends
ph_technical 21:29:30pm – reply the ph_item in the last minute
ph_user  service ph_technical – start the  ph_user  service after the reply time ends and before grace period ends
after making ph_technical 0, there was no tto.
the transaction was successfully completed.
same was test successfully in ph_name uat site.

we did comparison of some of the related procedures and  ph_user  services codes related to express ph_items grace period, and we did not find any major changes or no changes at all.
so, we request you to help us by trying to simulate the case in the old  ph_user  system, which will help us to know:
if the scenario is there in new  ph_user  only or it is there in the old  ph_user  system as well.
if it is not there in the old  ph_user , then we would be able to trace the modification ph_path applied for such cases.
looking forward for your feedback.
thank you
ph_user

the issue is reported for new  ph_user  only.
and we dont have old  ph_user  environment for scanning ph_items to simulate the case for now.

scan some ph_items in the express session and move to inward section.
reply these ph_items in the last minute of the reply time for the given express session.

thanks ,
ph_user
problem: foreign currency weekly sessions is not opening correctly on friday scheduled for every monday when there is holiday on monday.
investigation and simulation: the schedules for weekly session to be open of every monday for ph_technical are properly configured.
the weekend parameters were also configured properly.
these session opens correctly when there is no holiday on monday.
these session doesn't open for tuesday, whenever there is holiday on monday, instead we see some mis-behavior in the system and the weekly session opens for friday itself.
the issue was simulated in the uat and in local site as well.
development agile to address the issue it required code changes in the ph_technical package ph_technical, and new  ph_user  parameter was introduced ph_technical ph_technical 0 means use schedule only if flagged day is a working day, ph_technical 1 means if flagged day is a holiday then shift to next business day an so on

i checked with ph_name, in old system the field ph_technical ph_technical ph_technical , and sat ph_path is weekend for all the foreign currencies, the session used to open correctly for monday and if there was holiday on monday, the session used to open tuesday.
in the new system as well ph_name first tried with ph_technical ph_technical ph_technical, and foreign currencies weekend is sat ph_path , but the session did not open for monday.
so, ph_name tried with ph_technical ph_technical ph_technical, but the session did not open for tuesday when there is holiday on monday.
in the new system this weekly session opens correctly when there is no holiday on monday.
the weekend parameters for foreign currencies are ok in the new system, and the weekend parameters for ph_technical currency is changed since the weekend in  ph_user  is sat only as changed by the government.
thank you  ph_user  ph_name.

we checked the weekly session in the ph_technical schema in 6.52 uat server and the session did not opened for next working day if the scheduled day is a weekend.
test scenario 1:
weekend and foreign weekend set as wednesday(8 ph_path ).
disabled all the schedules except monday weekly ph_technical regular schedule (ph_technical) and sunday weekly ph_technical regular session(ph_technical).
change the ph_technical to ph_technical (for above ph_technical)to open for wednesday.
run the session job.
result: the session did not open on tuesday(8 ph_path ) to be active for thursday(8 ph_path )
test scenario 2:
weekend and foreign weekend set as sat,sun as usual.
disabled all the schedules except monday weekly ph_technical regular schedule (ph_technical) and sunday weekly ph_technical regular session(ph_technical).
change the ph_technical to ph_technical (for above ph_technical) to open for wednesday.
run the session job.
result: the session open on tuesday(8 ph_path ) to be active for wednesday(8 ph_path )
looking at the test results from the old schema, it seems this is the normal behavior of the system.
kindly check from your side if we could check anything further.

and due to higher frequency of ph_items getting locked its hampering the business.
also, when first user has already opened the ph_item for editing and if second user is trying to open, it should get locked for second user, but its not happening, when first user is editing the ph_item and second opens it ,the ph_items getting locked and its getting disappear from first users who is actually editing it.
this was working fine in old system.
please check.

there is no integration between ph_technical onus and ph_technical onus, so the ph_technical will not appear on ph_technical.
however, the ph_technical get auto rejected due the bank late response, might be cased by connection failure at certain amount of time.
regards
dear,
can we get the exact break point?
so we can investigate our internal ph_technical logs if needed.
for ph_technical participant its showing success status and nothing failed.
so business are confused why its auto rejected.
regards,

auto rejection cased by a late response does not inconsistent with ph_technical sent to its destination successfully, so its not a failure from business perspective.
hope that answered you question ph_technical
regards
dear,
i will rephrase my questions.
what can business do to insure this never happen again?
they confirmed accepting the ph_item and not delayed from their side.
where to check this type of failure and how to solve it in short time?
so the customer is not affected due to this delay.
can business process the same ph_technical again?
regards,
dear,
can you provide us a screenshots for change history?
you can find it on the ph_technical .
its a feature from ph_technical central can be shown on teller's ph_technical, and you can only solve it by presenting a new ph_item.
unfortunately, no it cant be processed twice, you have to present a new one as mentioned in point number two.

the data is not available in the source the query used is not pointing on the correct data the datasource used is not the correct one
i advise you to approach the developer to troubleshoot, as the ph_technical is up and running with no change in uat.
greetings
as we explained before, the ph_technical is ph_name database which has the customer account information and we are not having any control on it.
we already tested ph_technical system by changed the ph_technical connection to production ph_technical database and it was working fine, so it could be issue with the uat ph_technical database.
my advise is to restore the production ph_technical to uat database so we can test it again.
greetings
ph_technical team will be available also tomorrow at ph_technical to have a quick meeting regarding the uat db.
please add ph_user to the ph_technical teams invite.
greetings
sure, i will add him.
greetings
please copy the attached “ ph_technical ” to uat server to test it.
greetings
please find below response from ph_technical team.
ph_technical
then this is an application issue.
from ph_technical side, the ph_technical is available, and the user is accessible with the credentials previously shared, and with the necessary rights to create a session.
ph_technical
greetings
as i explained to you earlier, this ph_technical is an external database and it's not part of ph_technical application.
we already supported you in this case and found out that when we connect to the production ph_technical, the system is retrieving successfully.
we suggested retrieving the production schema to uat, but it was refused.
you  ph_user  refer to ph_technical ph_name ph_name for more information and  ph_user  he provide you with more details about it.

problem:
ph_item is returned by maker as “closed account” didn’t reach to checker queue
investigation and simulation:
collection of related jar files from production to analyze the flow and confirm the business flow.
the flow of the ph_item is decided based on the following from ph_technical page:
1. if the reason on the ph_item is accepted and the ph_item amount is greater than the ph_technical the ph_item will be moved to tech approval 2. if the reason on the ph_item is accepted and the ph_item amount is less than the ph_technical there are validations regarding the callback flag to determine the next flow of the ph_item.
3. if the reason for the ph_item is rejected and the ph_item amount is greater than the ph_technical the ph_item will be moved to tech approval 4. if the reason for the ph_item is rejected and the ph_item amount is less than the ph_technical the ph_item will be validated if its a ph_technical ph_item it will be moved to the onus pending page.
5. if the reason for the ph_item is rejected and the ph_item amount is less than the ph_technical the ph_item will be validated and sent to posting one service which has its  ph_user  business
please note that below are the ph_technical parameters set on ph_technical table and currently has values: ph_technical ph_technical
based on our current scenario, condition 2 is applicable and further there will validations regarding the callback flag to determine the next flow.
as seen from the response message, the bank call back flag was n which means the decision is not needed which based on the business flow will move the ph_item to posting one service which finished the flow(ph_technical) based on business ie.
sent directly to cbuae.
the bank is advised to further check with core banking system if they need any modification in the flow as per their business needs.

as still we did not receive the jar file from production for confirmation, however, regarding the flow for the ph_items to reach to ta page.
kindly check below scenarios:
in the ph_technical service there are 2 flows for the ph_item to go to the ph_technical page which are the following:
ph_item accepted with ph_item amount ph_technical x amount (inward routing amount) ph_technical routing to tech approval ph_item rejected with ph_item amount ph_technical z amount (inward ph_technical rejected routing amount) ph_technical routing to tech approval
hence, we don't have a specific business for the reason account closed to appear at ph_technical page.
kindly let us know if you have any further queries on this.

once ph_name rejects the  ph_user  with reason “ customer not found ” , ph_technical will reject the  ph_user  and return back the funds ph_technical this case should be handled for the customer that their information is corrected in ph_technical and to be migrated into ph_name in order to send outwards and receive inward payments ] if  ph_user  customer sends alias resolve with an arabic alias or spaces , ph_name will return back a response that should prevent the customer to proceed with his  ph_user , however, if the customer proceed with financial  ph_user , ph_name will reject the  ph_user  that will lead to return back the funds.
[ the mobile app must validate the data before sending to ph_name ].
as you can see, there is no way to handle each case separately, but we believe that this approach will reduce the partially accepted payments that occurred last week.

the issue of not able to upload ph_item from image capture page for specific customer name as “ ph_name , is because of ph_technical filter.
t he ph_technical work by finding typical patterns that  ph_user  be used as ph_technical attack vectors and removing such code fragments from user input data.
if we remove ph_technical filter it could cause a security vulnerability.
therefore keeping ph_technical filter makes application safe from any kind of ph_technical attacks.
previously, these kind of the issues were also seen in the inward which is already resolved but this time its for the image capture page.
regards,

as discussed over the phone,
the issue of not able to upload ph_item from image capture page for specific customer name as “ ph_name , is related to ph_technical .
this issue looks similar to the previous issue of not able to save note in inward, but these two has completely different scenario.
if still you want a fix for this then we have to rechange the ph_technical file and redeploy the ph_technical file to all the banks.
please reconfirm once from your side within ph_name team and let us know.

we discussed the case with the ph_technical and  ph_user , and it seems it is not from the ph_technical side.
but still if we want override the standard ph_technical library functionality to allow ph_name word in the scan page we will need to add extra validations, which will lead to change and override core system functionality which is not recommended from our side.
also, we could use alternatives to instead of the name ph_name , like ph_technical or ph_name.
so, kindly confirm if this could be handled from the ph_name side.
thank you  ph_user
greetings
as mentioned the customer name should match the  ph_user  system and bank side ph_technical for the acceptance of the ph_item.

this issue is related to temp folder on tomcat as the file should be removed automatically to avoid such cases.
however, you can use below script to be run on daily bases on application server as cron job through the os to keep removing files from temp folder to solve the issue .

after clearing the cache and temp file, now application performance is normal.
further, to find the root cause we are analyzing the logs.
greetings
we have analyzed the logs and there is no error related to slowness.
when we connected to resolve the issue we cleared the cache and temp file of the application and after that there is no such issue in the application.
so we suggest clearing the cache and temp every month to avoid such issues.
kindly let us know if you have any questions.

greetings based on our session , kindly note that this issue is not related to the last release, the issue is related to the db-restore activity done by dba at the ph_technical of september-2022 , we've patched the necessary constraints but for next restoration activities we prefer this to be done by us.
best regards,  ph_user   ph_user .
greetings based on the same session , we've noticed that a lot of our ph_technical tables are linked to ph_technical table which got renamed and altered by your dba during the restoration process , so most of our constraints on the uat system are now linked to the renamed table ph_technical instead of ph_technical, this might cause issues with the data integrity and some cases might arise later on because of this on uat env.
best regards,  ph_user   ph_user .
greetings reference to our previous conversation and based on our last session observations , kindly note that the current data existing on ph_technical schema on uat ph_technical has many constraint issues due to the restoration process used to rename current tables and keep our system constraints linked to the old tables, a new dump should be taken from prod ph_technical after working hours and restored to uat in order to ensure better data consistency , we also need the data from prod to test the archiving process we're about to start deploying on the new created schema, appreciate your quick action on this to prepare the necessary internally , also please let us know if there's any need for us to participate with your internal dba to take the necessary dump as per needed best regards,  ph_user   ph_user .
ph_user
dears ph_user ph_user
kindly note that we will be deploying the new resales script on the already ph_technical schema to avoid the below constraints issue ,first we need the latest ph_country rollout updated scripts to check all is deployed on ph_technical schema correctly as we couldn't downloaded them from the previously shared url then we need the updated script for the currently uploaded release also to be deployed on the ph_technical schema after that we will do the sit on the new items and update you with the result .
best regards .
greetings
kindly note that the old ph_technical schema is deprecated and we cannot guarantee it's identical from production, we already moved to another schema because there is an issue with data and we only kept it for reference.
this practice is very quick in order to avoid unexpected issues due to the wrong restore.
we can drop all of them and keep the new restored one, please feel free to contact us if you have any constraints ph_path .
regards,
ph_user
greetings we've switched the app to use the old schema ph_technical instead of ph_technical , and we have executed all of the latest uat release scripts on top of the old schema, the creation user issue is not showing we've verified that by creating a new user and approve it, please verify other items and get back to us if there's anything needed from our side.

as out management are asking for reasons.
thanks
greetings
regarding the root cause we have 2 parts below :
1- slowness issue
this issue was solved after applying the ph_technical recommendations by increasing the sequence cache as oracle was not able to return the sequence fast enough to the caller which caused massive delays in the big batches, our recommendation here is to implement the archive system to offload the production database.
2- batch has not reached ph_name
this is related to the shutdown which was made in the middle of the process which case this issue and we will investigate shutdown behavior as you should be able to restart the application anytime with no effect on the process.
greetings
we have ph_technical batch under ph_name outward failed batches with “ph_technical generating failed step” which is not normal behavior and ph_technical batch with status of “waiting central ph_technical reply step” which is not normal behavior which is not normal behavior.
kindly advice
greetings
for batches with status waiting central reply ph_technical reply step there is no issue, all of them assigned to the today session, once the central report arrived all of statuses will be reflected.
for ph_technical generating failed step, we will investigate the issue and get back to you asap.

with reference to our connection yesterday:
we have performed full investigation of the system and all components that might contribute not to have the system processing inward files.
final finding was that files which contains transactions that are considered stp (value ph_technical ph_technical ph_technical based on stp rules) hold the system while trying to communicate with core banking system.
restarting system and reset for webservice on core banking system side doesnt help.
actions we took and next steps:
1- we have disabled the stp role and now all transactions are processed as non-stp.
ph_name team will need to process these transactions manually on core banking system as we agreed.
2- ph_name team confirmed to have the role as its now (with no stp processing) until they finish end of month traffic.
3- ph_name to develop a fix which will include more logs on the communication with core banking and not to allow system to hand on one transaction if communication with core banking is not initiated.
eta for fix to be ready is by end of day thursday 1.12.2022
4- ph_name will try to help ph_name to investigate network level traffic when calling core banking webservice using sniffing tool (ph_technical) once the fix is ready.

we discussed internally with dev team about the exceptions that we seen in the attached log.
we came to the following conclusion ;
error related to the listing of batchs:
ph_logs
ph_technical
though this message displayed as error in the logs, it is not an actual error.
this message is generated in log to preserve the batch information that could be helpful during any kind of issues.
similarly, report generation exceptions as from below also not an actual error.
this message is generated in the log to preserve the sql query related with the report.
ph_logs
also, we checked with other site, the log generation of above messages is exactly similar as it is in ph_name.
so, there is no any negative impact to keeping this log as it is.
for the third exceptions as shown below, we could not replicate but we are still investigating.
so, better if we could connect to know the actual scenario when this error actually occurs.

if you want to move these messages to either info or debug level , then we will discuss with the  ph_user .
but doing so , we  ph_user  need to change the log level every time if we want to trace the related information in case of issues.

according to our phone call , kindly we need away to disable tls ph_version and ph_version on ports ph_technical, ph_technical, ph_technical.
regards
1- executive summary:
ph_technical
2- problem description:
they need a way to disable tls ph_version and ph_version on ports ph_technical, ph_technical, and ph_technical.
3-problem identification:
dec 14, 2022, @ 01:27 pm: we have connected to the customer on the test environment and done the below two points: 1- adding the (ph_technical) on the file ph_path.
2- adding the ph_technical on the profile.
dec 29, 2022, @ 10:27 am: the customer needs to rescan again and provide us with the report.
ph_user  04, 2023, @ 10:20 am: still the vulnerability appeared as an attached report.
ph_user  09, 2023, @ 02:20 pm: the protocols ph_technical and ph_technical are disabled and ph_technical was enabled on the server please check it and get feedback.
ph_user  10, 2023, @ 08:55 am: the bank needs evidence that both protocols are disabled.
ph_user  10, 2023, @ 09:01 am: the screenshot of the evidence has been uploaded to the ticket.
ph_user  15, 2023, @ 12:23 pm: the bank needs an explanation and i update them below:
already, i have uploaded the three screenshots that explained the status for each protocol on the os side (ph_technical, ph_technical, ph_technical) using the below commands:
ph_technical
ph_technical
that means, if the protocol is not enabled for the particular target ( ph_ip_address ph_technical), you will see an ssl error, and the output will indicate that it is not able to obtain any certificate information (identical screenshots ph_file and ph_file).
if a protocol is enabled for the particular target ( ph_ip_address ph_technical), you will see the complete certificate of the server (screenshot ph_file).
and also from the app site (tomcat), we successfully disabled tls (ph_version and ph_version) on the site ( ph_ip_address ) by adding the (ph_technical, ph_technical) to the file ph_path and adding the ph_technical on the  ph_user  profile.
we have already applied these configurations on both tomcat and ph_technical from our side so disabling tls protocol is done from our scope perhaps there is a further action that can be done by your os team to disable these protocols from ph_technical or server configurations.
ph_user  29, 2023, @ 09:55 am: i ask them for any update.
ph_user  29, 2023, @ 10:30 am: the bank answered the deployment for a fix on the production will be next week.
feb 2, 2023, @ 10:12 am: i ask the bank to connect after the session closes to deploy the fix.
feb 2, 2023, @ 03:49 pm: they postponed until next thursday(feb 9, 2023).
feb 9, 2023, @ 2:30 pm: i ask the bank to connect after the session closes to deploy the fix.
feb 9, 2023, @ 06:05 pm: we applied the fix on the server's production side exactly (server ph_technical and server ph_technical) and restart the tomcats after applying it.
feb 21, 2023:the bank update us we can close the ticket.
4- corrective action: 1- adding the (ph_technical, ph_technical, ph_technical, ph_technical) on the file ph_path.
2- adding the ph_technical on the  ph_user  profile.
5- conclusion and recommendation: to disable tls ph_version and ph_version 1- adding the (ph_technical, ph_technical, ph_technical, ph_technical) on the file ph_path.
2- adding the ph_technical on the  ph_user  profile.

please find the attached video showing the ph_technical scanner is working fine without any issues on our side, however currently there is an issue over uat due to the service being stuck and disconnected.
regards,
ph_user
greetings referring to our meeting today, we've verified that the issue you're facing with the scanning process is related to the scanner hardware you're using.
we've scanned three ph_items as a single scan, and all of them went to the system smoothly.
then, we tried to do a bulk scan by doing a workaround to feed the scanner tray ph_item by ph_item instead of loading them all at once, and that worked fine as well.
my recommendation for future releases and better testing results to avoid such scenarios is that we obtain a new working ph_technical scanner that is fully functional, similar to what the client already has, as well as a ph_technical scanner, so you can test both scanners on uat or in a prod environment to simulate any internal issues for better support quality.
we appreciate your feedback regarding the testing results and when we can move the new changes to prod to finalize this.

greetings, please find the needed
14. dec. 2022 worked with dev team internally to release the new needed hotfix mentioned in the attached doc with name “ph_technical” then deploy the same fix on client's uat env , we had a global index that being used by all of the system's scanners , we have added a new json file to override this behavior since each scanner has a different index.
17:30 22:00 15. dec. 2022 worked with bank's it and business team to deploy the same fix on client's prod env , for the same release we've provided them after receiving the feedback to move the same release from uat env to prod servers.
17:30 20:00
problem: the system is supporting one scanner type to be used at a time while it should support multiple scanner models.
investigation and simulation: a global index of the first image sent by the scanner (document) was used by the system, we've added a new mapping file to send the correct index value of each scanner model.

solution:
1- did we resolve the problem and its symptoms?
yes.
2- did we understand and resolve the root cause of the problem?
yes, same to what have been explained above, this is because a fixed index value is being used by the system while each scanner model require a different index value.
